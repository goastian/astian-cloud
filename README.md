**Astian Cloud** is a customized version of the Nextcloud Server, designed to integrate with centralized authentication systems via OAuth2, while maintaining full compatibility with the AGPL-3.0 license and credits to the original project.

---

## ℹ️ About this version

This fork has been **adapted and extended** specifically to work with [`Astian Account`](https://github.com/goastian/astian-account), enabling an advanced federated authentication and service-based access control system.

It is ideal for environments that require:

-   Centralized and delegated authentication (SSO).
-   Integration with external identities through OpenID Connect.
-   Custom login flow handling in Nextcloud.

## 🔐 Session and Authentication Requirements

This version **explicitly requires** the [`user_oidc`](https://github.com/elyerr/user_oidc) plugin to be **installed and enabled**.

Additionally, to properly establish a session through federated login, an OAuth2-compliant server is required:

-   [`Astian Account`](https://github.com/goastian/astian-account) (**recommended**) that implements standard OpenID Connect flows.

### 🛠 Required Configuration

To ensure login works correctly, you must to Add the following to your `config/config.php`:

```php
'trusted_domains' => [
    'https://aouth2.domain.xyz' // oauth-passport-server domain
  ],
 'user_oidc' => [
    'httpclient.allowselfsigned' => true, // Olny dev mode
    'prompt' => 'internal',
    'store_login_token' => true,
  ],
  'oauth2_passport_server' => [
    'master' => 'https://aouth2.domain.xyz', // oauth-passport-server domain
    'httpclient.allowselfsigned' => true, // Olny dev mode
  ],
  'allow_local_remote_servers' => true,
```
